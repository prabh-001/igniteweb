üöÄ Ignite: Your Learning & Productivity Hub
Ignite is a student-first web application designed as a digital Swiss Army knife for learning and productivity. It's built to streamline your study flow by bringing essential tools and quick-study resources together in one place.

This project was developed as a submission for the NodeForSpeed 3.0 hackathon, following the "Micro Magic" theme of building small projects with a big impact.

üí° Features
Ignite combines several mini-projects into a single, cohesive platform:

Productivity Tools: A dedicated space with a Pomodoro Timer, a To-Do List, and a Timetable to help you manage your time and tasks effectively.

Education Hub: A central area to save and organize your study resources, like lecture videos and notes. You can mark resources as "studied" to track your progress.

Progress Tracker: A dashboard that provides a quick overview of your study habits, including tasks completed, study minutes, and resources watched. You can also set a weekly study goal to stay motivated.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
HTML: For the structure of the website.

CSS: For styling and layout.

JavaScript: For all interactive functionality and data management.

‚úçÔ∏è About the Project
Ignite was created with the goal of solving a common problem students face: managing multiple tools and resources across different platforms. By connecting these mini-projects, we've created an ecosystem where data from one tool (e.g., the Pomodoro Timer) feeds into another (the Progress Tracker), providing a seamless and integrated experience.
